### Hi there 👋 I am Rechie!

I am a random 👦 who live on a planet called '🌏'. I am very ordinary and I just coding as a way to escape from reality.
In the past, I spent most of the time on C# for Unity and I admit it is a bad idea because making a game is very tiring.
I ended up giving up because I hate my artwork (not coding's fault). At the same time, I also did some research on web development
for my school project. Because of it, I leart HTML, CSS, javascript, React, PHP and some MySQL.

In a nutshell, I spent a lot of time on coding (probably because I don't have money to buy games 😢).

### Technology That I Have Immerse Myself In

You have run: `SELECT name FROM technology ORDER BY experience DESC`
Output:
| name |
| ------- |
| javascript|
| HTML |
| C# |
| CSS |
| PHP |
| python |
| MySQL|

To be honest, I don't consider myself a very smart guy and this list will be outdate soon.

### Past project

I know this is very little and I haven't do the documentation for some project 😔

## Rechie's Portfolio

This repository is also for my not-so-good just-for-learning portfolio. I made it because I doubt myself on my CSS and vanila javascript skill.
