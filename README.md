### Hi there 👋 I am Rechie! 😊

I am a random 👦 who live on a planet called '🌏'. I am very ordinary and I just coding as a way to escape from reality.

In the past, I spent most of the time on C# for Unity. At the same time, I also did some research on web development
for my school project. Because of it, I leart HTML, CSS, javascript, React, PHP and some MySQL.

In a nutshell, I spent a lot of time on coding (literally everyday, just lazy to `git push`).
