            Hi! I am Rechie. I do code. Like, I do coding 80% of my time, to the point that I should 
            code less and do more social interaction.

            I started programming around 10 years old (?). I didn't put all my time
            into coding as I also did some other graphic-related stuff like vector art
            and 3D modeling (All the images in this website is drawn by me).
            
            These days I code more in lower languages, such as C, C++ and assembly.
            I still know some high-level languages like python and javascript.

            Right now I am busy with college stuff and my hardware is going stale and slow. 
            This is the reason why I ended up in lower level languages as it is more performant.
            Now I just do whatever I think it is cool, like making a [making a simple toy OS](https://github.com/RechieKho/piko-piko),
            or maybe make a neural network in C?

            For the future, I geniunely have no idea what will it be. I don't think FAANG will hire me because 
            I am like, thousands and thousands miles away from the their headquaters. I might become a doctor 
            instead(?). I would love to combine computer and biology together. I like STEM.
