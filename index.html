            Welcome to this website. This website introduces an individual
            called 'Rechie'. Coincidentally, this website is made by this
            individual. The purpose of this website is to introduce the
            individual. Without this purpose, this website is nothing. Thus, it
            is important to have a purpose.

            This individual starts programming as soon as he turns 10 years old.
            Unfortunately, this individual didn't practice a lot. But still,
            Rechie managed to learn various programming language such as C#,
            Python, Javascript, C and C++. Rechie also does some music composing
            and graphic designing without prior knowledge.

            For now, this individual is developing a game using godot game
            engine. Rechie still plans to start more side projects in order to
            escape game developement. Rechie also plans to install other Linux
            distro and abandon Gentoo Linux since the machine is too weak for
            compiling the whole system.
